  - test
  - deploy

# This is the name of the job. You can choose it freely.

  # A job is always executed within a stage. If no stage is set, it defaults to 'test'
  stage: test
  # Since we require Maven for this job, we can restrict the job to runners with a certain tag. Of course, we need to configure a runner with the tag maven with a maven installation

  # Here you can execute arbitrate terminal commands.
  # If any of the commands returns a non zero exit code the job fails
